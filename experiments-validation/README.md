## Validation experiment

The experiment is implemented in a combination of MATLAB and Julia code.

The file `experiment_NARMAX.m` runs the offline Iterative Least-Squares baseline. The notebook "experiment_NARMAX.ipynb" runs the online Recursive Least-Squares baseline and our Free Energy Minimisation estimator. The notebook `collect-results.ipynb` collects all generated result files and plots the figures in the paper.
